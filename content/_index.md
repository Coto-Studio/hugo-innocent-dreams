Then one day my Dad, got a phone call out of the blue, my biological family had been searching for me for 14 years.

Then one day my adoptive parents got a phone call that would change the course of my life and take me on a journey to

That phone call would take me on journey to the city streets of Costa Rica, the volcanic hilltops of Panama, and to the rural country side of El Salvador, my homeland.

An adventure that to this day I'm entirely sure if it was a dream, reality, or a bit of both.

If I dreamt it, it really happened, or a bit of both.

## About the author

Nelson/Roberto

{{< image src="https://static.nelsonroberto.com/images/jalan-square.jpg" class="left" >}}

I was separated from my birth family during El Salvador’s civil war and was reunited with them in 1997 at the age of 16.

I am an author, marketer, and technologist who has worked on a wide range of entrepreneurial projects, such as helping to scale an embroidery business in Panamá, consulting on a crowdfunding campaign to fight patent trolls, and producing a documentary film about El Salvador's disappeared children.

If there has been one consistency through my varied and unconventional career, it’s that I thrive when I’m working to organize chaotic, unpredictable environments. Whether it’s programming software applications, designing business processes, or creating a compelling narrative, I love the challenge of finding elegant solutions for complex, multi-dimensional problems that have no easy answer. I'm a skilled problem solver who has taught himself everything from web design to marketing to narrative story structure.
