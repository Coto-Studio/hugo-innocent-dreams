displayDescription: "Growing up, my parents couldn't tell me why I had been given up for adoption. All they knew was that I spent a year in an orphanage in Honduras. At night, I would sit on the edge of my bed, stare into the black, and wonder, where are the people who look like me?"

**Then one day, in 1997, my Dad got a phone call that turned my world upside down.**

A human rights organization was searching for an infant, the son of revolutionaries guerrillas, who had been violently separated from his family in the early 80s during El Salvador's civil war. They believed I was that child, and if I was willing to take a DNA test, it would confirm this unbelievable story and reunite me with my missing past.

That fateful decision took me on an epic adventure to the city streets, volcanic hilltops, and rural countryside of Central America, eventually leading me back to my homeland of El Salvador. As I fostered a deep connection with my biological father and siblings, I discovered a life taken from me. But when the reality of the working world forced me to choose between a career and my newfound family, I had to figure out how to balance the demands of two distinct cultures or give up on my pursuit of a normal life.

Even now, over 20 years later, as I look back on these events, I'm not entirely sure if it all was a dream, reality, or a bit of both.

My name is Nelson de Witt, but it's also Roberto Coto. I am one of El Salvador's Disappeared Children, kids who were separated from their families during the country's 13-year long civil war.

I am an author, marketer, and technologist who has worked on a wide range of entrepreneurial projects, such as helping to scale an embroidery business in Panam√°, and consulting on a crowdfunding campaign to fight patent trolls.

My work has been featured in [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/03/el-salvador-adoption-identifying-nelson_n_1073980.html), and [The Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2013/1019/Former-missing-child-in-El-Salvador-s-civil-war-tells-his-journey-in-film), as well as several podcasts. I've spoken about my story at a number of high schools and colleges including [Yale University](https://erm.yale.edu/event/identifying-nelson-film-qa-filmmaker-nelson-de-witt), Wellesley College, and The University of Chicago.

Along side the book I am working on a documentary film called [Identifying Nelson/Buscando a Roberto](https://www.identifyingnelson.com/), which is about El Salvador's disappeared children.
