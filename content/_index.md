displayDescription: "Growing up, my parents couldn't tell me why I had been given up for adoption. All they knew was that I spent a year in an orphanage in Honduras. At night, I would sit on the edge of my bed, stare into the black, and wonder, where are the people who look like me?"

**Then one day, in 1997, Dad got a phone call that turned my world upside down.**

A human rights organization was searching for an infant, the son of revolutionaries, who had been violently separated from his family in the early 80s during El Salvador's civil war. They believed I was that child, and if I was willing to take a DNA test, it would confirm this unbelievable story and reunite me with my missing past.

That fateful decision took me on an epic adventure to the city streets, volcanic hilltops, and rural countryside of Central America, eventually leading me back to my homeland of El Salvador. As I fostered a deep connection with my biological father and siblings, I discovered a life taken from me. But when the reality of the working world forced me to choose between a career and my newfound family, I had to figure out how to balance the demands of two distinct cultures or give up on my pursuit of a normal life.

Even now, over 20 years later, as I look back on these events, I'm not entirely sure if it all was a dream, reality, or a bit of both.

## About the author

{{< image src="https://static.nelsonroberto.com/images/profile_square.jpg" class="left" >}}

I was separated from my birth family during El Salvador’s civil war and was reunited with them in 1997 at the age of 16.

I am an author, marketer, and technologist who has worked on a wide range of entrepreneurial projects, such as helping to scale an embroidery business in Panamá, consulting on a crowdfunding campaign to fight patent trolls, and producing a documentary film about El Salvador's disappeared children.

If there has been one consistency through my varied and unconventional career, it’s that I thrive when I’m working to organize chaotic, unpredictable environments. Whether it’s programming software applications, designing business processes, or creating a compelling narrative, I love the challenge of finding elegant solutions for complex, multi-dimensional problems that have no easy answer. I'm a skilled problem solver who has taught himself everything from web design to marketing to narrative story structure.
