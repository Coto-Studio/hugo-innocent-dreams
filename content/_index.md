Then one day my Dad, got a phone call out of the blue, my biological family had been searching for me for 14 years.

Then one day my adoptive parents got a phone call that would change the course of my life and take me on a journey to

That phone call would take me on journey to the city streets of Costa Rica, the volcanic hilltops of Panama, and to the rural country side of El Salvador, my homeland.

An adventure that to this day I'm entirely sure if it was a dream, reality, or a bit of both.

If I dreamt it, it really happened, or a bit of both.
