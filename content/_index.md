Welcome, and thank you so much for taking an interest in my work.

I’m sharing this at a time when life feels upside-down, and it’s hard to make sense of the world around us. Events on this scale are not only difficult to process but make it hard to find a sense of normality. At least, that is how I felt in 1997 when I first learned about the existence of my birth family.

Even though it was stressful and overwhelming at the time, the experience taught me a valuable life lesson, change is part of life. Sometimes that change can be painful and confusing and, at other times, a cause for celebration. While your life may never return to the way it was, you may find something new that you had no idea you needed.

I hope that my story offers you some comfort, or at the very least, a distraction from the onslaught of upsetting news. Thanks again for being part of my journey, it really does mean the world to me.

## What you are reading

{{< image-left src="https://static.nelsonroberto.com/innocent-dreams/Waking-From-Innocent-Dreams-Cover.png" >}}

You are about to read Act I of my upcoming autobiographical novel _Waking From Innocent Dreams_. It consists of twelve chapters (roughly 114 pages) and should take approximately 4 hours to read.

The first act is one of the most critical parts of a book because it is supposed to “hook” the reader, so they will want to read the entire story. That is why I’ve chosen this section of the book for you to read. After you have finished the reading, there is [an optional survey](/survey/) if you would like to provide me with feedback.

Please note that this text is still in draft form, which means it may contain errors and could change in the coming months.

## The type of feedback I’m looking for

One of my favorite quotes about receiving feedback comes from author Neil Gaiman.

> “When someone says something is wrong, they’re usually right. When someone tells you why it’s wrong or how to fix it, they’re usually wrong.”

In other words, it’s not your job to tell me **how** to fix my story, just that something is _off_.

Generally speaking, I’m looking for your impressions of the work and how it affected you. What did you like about it? Were there any parts that fell flat or that didn’t make sense? That kind of thing.

I’m also interested in knowing about what I can cut from the text. My editor wants me to remove around 2,500 words or little over a chapter, so if you have any suggestions about that, I’d love to hear them.

If you have specific feedback about a chapter or scene, I would love to hear that as well. But please don’t feel obligated to give me a detailed breakdown of every aspect of the story.

## Spelling and ~~Type-o’s~~ Type-os

I’ve already had several people proofread this text, so there should be very few of these errors. However, if you find a mistake and _feel compelled to fix it_, make a note of where the error occurred and let me know in the [survey](/survey/)

## Due date

The due date for your feedback is: **Monday, June 27th, 2020**

Obviously, life is kind of up in the air right now, so please do not feel bad if you are unable to complete the reading by that time. I do not depend on any single person’s feedback, and I have plenty of other work to keep me busy in the meantime.

## Ways to Read

There are several different ways to read my manuscript, based on the device you are using.

If you are reading on a phone or tablet, then I recommend downloading the ePub version or reading from this website, because the text will adapt better to the size of your screen.

If you are reading on a desktop or laptop computer, then I recommend choosing the PDF version or reading online.

I’ve placed links to each format at the bottom of the page.

## One more thing…

This book is still a work in progress and I’m not quite ready to share this publicly, so **please do not share this site**, or post a link to it on social media. Thank you.

If you would like to share this manuscript with a friend, colleague, or significant other, **please ask me first**, chances are I will say yes. If you don’t already have it, my contact information can be found below.
