This is a short survey that should take roughly **5 to 10 minutes** to complete. Also, there is the option of providing feedback via voice or video call (FaceTime, Skype, etc.). Providing feedback this way is not only easier in some situations, but it would also be nice to catch up with you in these crazy times.

_If you have a lot of feedback or want to provide spelling/type-o corrections, then I recommend taking this on a computer._
