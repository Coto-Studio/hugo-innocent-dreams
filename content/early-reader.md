## Instructions

First of all, I just want to say thank you so much for taking an interest in my work. This project has been a labor of love for the past six years and I cannot wait for you to read it.

Since I am [pursuing traditional publishing]({{< ref "pursuing-traditional-publishing" >}}), I have been advised not to share the manuscript publicly because it is frowned upon by the industry. This means I'm unable to post excerpts from the book on my website or send around a digital PDF version. As a middle ground, I have printed a few copies of the manuscript that I am lending out, in exchange for feedback.

If you would be interested in getting on the early reader waiting list please fill out the form below. Then at some point during the next year, I will mail you the book, or give it to you in person. I'll check in with you before sending it and when you are done you can mail it back or drop it off at my house. (My address, along with instructions, is printed on page 2 of the book.)

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me [using the email address below](#contact-info).
