### Thank You!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my manuscript. Your interest in my work means a lot to me.

Over the course of writing this book, I've come to view feedback as a vital part of the process. So, I hope that you provide your honest opinion about my work because I want to make the best story possible.

**All questions are optional,** except for your name and email because that's how I'm keeping track of everyone. I want you to feel comfortable sharing as much or as little as you would like.

Thanks again for reading my book and I look forward to hearing what you thought about it!
