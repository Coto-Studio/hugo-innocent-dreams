Hello Dartmouth Students,

I had a great time visiting your class the other week. I put together this short survey because, in some ways, you are the ideal reader/viewer for my work, and I'd love to get to know you a little bit more.

All questions are optional, and the survey can be answered anonymously. I'm sure you're busy and have much to do, so I appreciate you taking the time to participate.

Thanks so much for being a great audience, and I hope to visit again once both projects are complete.

All the best,<br />Nelson/Roberto
