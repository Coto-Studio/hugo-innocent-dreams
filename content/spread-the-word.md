With my manuscript done, most of the hard work of writing and editing is behind me. However, now begins the potentially even harder work of getting my book into the world. Each year hundreds of thousands of books are published, most of which languish in obscurity, only selling a handful of copies.

[Shawn Coyne](https://storygrid.com/about/), a former editor at [Doubleday](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleday_(publisher)>) with over 30 years of publishing experience, says that the key to a book's long-term success is getting 10,000 people to "sincerely give it a try."

> "Exposing 10,000 people who care about the arena of your book gives you a chance that enough of them will actually read it and then recommend it to someone else. That word of mouth will keep the book alive from one year to the next."[^1]

I'm not going to lie getting my book in the hands of that many people feels like an impossible mountain to climb. So why bother trying? Because as Salvadoran author [Roberto Lovato](https://robertolovato.com) points out:

> With the exception of a few Salvadoran writers publishing with independent presses, [Joan Didion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion) and other white US writers were the only tellers of Salvadoran stories in the English language.[^2]

I truly believe my book has a chance at changing this, or at the very least making a significant contribution to the conversation.

Growing up, these events often left me feeling alone and overwhelmed with {==events out of my control==}. In recent years, stories like _Encanto_, _Gentefied_, and _In The Heights_ have meant so much to me because they have given a voice to some of the difficult emotions I've had to deal with. It is my hope that my book will act in a similar manner for Salvadorans who live with the messy aftermath of our country's 13-year-long civil war.

That's where I need your help. If my story is going to get any real traction in a crowded marketplace then {==I will need all the help I can get.==} So I'm hoping you will help me spread the word about my story and this book by following at least one of the steps below:

### 1. Sign up for my newsletter.

I know we all get a lot of emails these days but the number of subscribers really does help. It shows potential partners that there are people interested in the story when it comes out.

Emails are sent out on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month. One is an original piece of content, for example, my Beyond The Book series, and the other is an author update about the progress of the book.

**If you have any interest in buying my book when it's out, I strongly recommend joining the mailing list.**
