Hello,

I'm really excited about our upcoming workshop on **How to Tell A Personal Story**. It's going to be an action-packed experience.

If you could answer the questions below, that would help me better understand where you are in your writing journey and what kind of support you're looking for. It also allows you to reflect ahead of time so you're clear on your goals and needs for the workshop.

We'll start promptly at 10:00 am EST, so sign into the Zoom room a few minutes early. If you want to hang out and drink coffee, I will start the call 15 minutes early.

Here is our tentative schedule\* for the workshop:

- 10:00 am EST - Kick-off + Welcome
- Part 1
- Part 2
- 10:30 EST - Break (5 minutes)
- Part 3
- 11:15 pm EST - Break (5 minutes)
- Part 4
- 11:30 am EST - Wrap-up + Goodbye

_\*I'll do my best to stick to the schedule, but it is subject to change. Mostly, I want you to know that there will be breaks!_

We will be doing a little group work along with writing exercises, so come prepared with your favorite writing implement, digital or analog. The workshop will not be recorded, but don't worry about trying to capture everything we cover, as I will share the slides along with some bonus material afterward.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

See you on Saturday, March 2nd!<br />Nelson/Roberto
